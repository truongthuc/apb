# AI Project Bootstrap

| Section | Guidance |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | APB is a small bootstrap tool for starting AI-assisted software projects with a shared agent workflow. |
| Current version | v0.1 copies template files, replaces `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, produces a usable project bootstrap, and provides local agent-native context routing. It does not include hooks, profiles, blueprints, plugins, or orchestration. |
| Requirements | Use Node.js 18 or newer, npm, and a target directory that is missing or empty. |
| Install locally | Run `cd apb`, then `npm link`. This exposes `create-apb`, `apb-render-project-info`, and `apb-context` globally on the machine. |
| Verify local install | Run `which create-apb`, `which apb-render-project-info`, and `which apb-context`. |
| Upgrade the local APB checkout | Run `git switch master`, `git pull --ff-only`, and `npm test` from the APB repository. Because `npm link` points to the local checkout, rerun it only when the global commands are missing or the repository has not been linked before. |
| New projects after an upgrade | Projects created after the pull receive the latest templates, agent rules, and vendored context-routing runtime automatically. |
| Existing projects after an upgrade | Previously generated projects keep their current vendored runtime and `.agent/` memory. APB v0.1 does not migrate non-empty projects automatically, so do not rerun `create-apb` in place; review and migrate the `.agent/` changes separately. Running the global resolver alone does not upgrade project rules or feature capsules. |
| Run without global link | Use `npm run create-apb -- ../my-project` or `npm run render-project-info -- ../my-project/input/ba-description.md ../my-project`. |
| Create a new project | Run `create-apb ../my-project`, or run `node bin/create-apb.js ../my-project` from this repository. |
| Target directory rule | The target directory may be missing or empty. The generator stops if the target directory already contains files. |
| First generated files to read | Start from `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/AGENTS.md`, `.agent/index.md`, `.agent/project-context.md`, `.agent/planning/00-bootstrap.md`, and `.agent/planning/01-task-list.md`. |
| Suggested agent prompt | `Read AGENTS.md and begin the APB bootstrap workflow for this project.` |
| Render BA documents | Run `apb-render-project-info ../my-project/input/ba-description.md ../my-project`, or pass a directory such as `apb-render-project-info ../my-project/input/docs ../my-project`. |
| Renderer output | The renderer creates `.agent/planning/02-project-summary.md`. It reads `.md`, `.txt`, and `.docx` files, extracts recognizable sections, and lists unsupported files in the generated summary. |
| Renderer overwrite rule | The renderer refuses to overwrite an existing `.agent/planning/02-project-summary.md`. Review or rename the existing file before running it again. |
| Generated project structure | Generated projects include `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.agent/` with agent rules, a note-linked memory index, planning, docs, architecture decisions, review history, artifacts, previews, and reviews. |
| Agent documentation location | Agent-facing planning and documentation live under `.agent/`. Root `docs/` is optional and should be reserved for human-facing documentation outside the agent workflow. |
| Note-linked memory | `.agent/index.md` is the durable navigation map. APB uses Obsidian-inspired note linking while keeping required knowledge in plain Markdown with relative Markdown links. Editor-only features such as wiki links, canvas files, or Dataview queries must remain supplemental. |
| Context routing | Agents automatically resolve non-trivial natural-language tasks through `.agent/features/` capsules. Routing connects knowledge to source entry points, implementation boundaries, dependencies, and tests while keeping broad feature files at metadata level until needed. |
| Vendored runtime | `create-apb` copies the context-routing runtime into `.agent/tools/context-routing/`, so generated repositories remain self-contained after cloning and do not require a global APB installation for automatic agent routing. |
| Incremental context | `apb-context` caches source hashes, symbols, and common imports under ignored `.agent/runtime/` state. It keeps independent per-feature baselines and per-task overlays, follows transitive local dependencies and reverse callers, and reports feature/task deltas. |
| Self-maintenance | The resolver proposes stale-entrypoint repairs and newly discovered source bindings with evidence. Agents apply exact safe repairs automatically and promote other bindings only after code, tests, or an approved design validates them. Capsule revision and context state refresh after accepted maintenance. |
| Agent bridge policy | Root `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are thin bridge files that point to `.agent/AGENTS.md`. `.agent/AGENTS.md` remains the source of truth. |
| Workflow discipline | Generated projects use a review-first workflow: planning, planning review, frozen planning, implementation design, design review, frozen design, milestone implementation, code review, fixes, documentation updates, and agent knowledge updates. |
| Handling unclear context | Generated agent rules require Open Questions instead of silent guessing. Owner answers are routed into the appropriate `.agent/` memory files. |
| Existing projects | APB v0.1 does not initialize non-empty existing projects automatically. Use APB on a missing or empty target directory for now. |
| Troubleshooting install | If `create-apb` is not found after `npm link`, check npm's global bin path with `npm bin -g`. |
| Troubleshooting target directory | If the target directory is not empty, create a new empty directory or wait for a future existing-project initialization command. |
| Troubleshooting renderer output | If `apb-render-project-info` says the output file already exists, review `.agent/planning/02-project-summary.md` before removing or archiving it. |
| Design principle | Delay abstraction until implementation demonstrates the need. |
| Publication status | This repository is ready to be hosted on GitHub as a public source repository. The package is marked private because APB v0.1 is not prepared for npm registry publication yet. |
